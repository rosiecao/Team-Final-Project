## Machine Learning Model

### Overview: 

Using a supervised machine learning model, we will train and test our model to examine and identify if certain living conditions have a correlation with our crime severity scores. 

### Goal: 

Using our crime severity scores our model will determine if crime severity has a correlation with our data representing living condition features. We determined living conditions based on community resilience scores (employment, population, and transportation scores) and affordability (average total assessed value).


### Results: 

An outlook on how much effect each variable for living conditions has in relation to crime incident severity.
